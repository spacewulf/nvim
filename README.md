# Neovim Config for Server Installations and overall Lightweight Instances

This neovim config is designed for the many servers and VMs that I use that are not necessarily going to be running any code and whatnot. With that in mind, some things are removed, such as proper support for some LSPs as well as DAP, but added some that are more server-oriented, such as yamlls, bashls, etc..
